check the bubble.
Position the spirit level in a transverse direction on the table guides under the tailstock and
check the bubble.
Repeat these operations frequently and, if necessary, make small corrections by screwing
and/or unscrewing the adjustable feet below the pallet.
8.3.3 Levelling the lathe rails
Place the level on the sides of the carriage and move it slowly along its entire length while
checking that the bubble does not change.
If the bubble moves, adjust the adjustable feet until it reaches a uniform level throughout the
entire course of the carriage.
Periodically check these measurements (at least every six months).
