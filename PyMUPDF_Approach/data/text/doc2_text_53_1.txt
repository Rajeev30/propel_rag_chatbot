Adjusting the tension of the motor belts
Make sure the motor belt tension is at an appropriate level. In this regard, make a simple
check by pressing down firmly on the individual belts (approximately in the middle), which
should move by a maximum of 5 mm.
If the belts are loose or too tight, loosen the belt adjustment system bolts until the correct
tension is achieved.

Proper belt tension reduces wear and increases the production of the machine.
