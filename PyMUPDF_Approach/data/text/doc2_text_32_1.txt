On the tailstock there are manual controls (levers, handwheels and screws) which allow fine
adjustments and feed adjustments (see Figure 24).

Quill locking lever: The lever allows the tailstock quill to be locked (located on the
side not visible in Figure 24)
(S)
Handwheel for longitudinal movement of the quill: The handwheel allows the
quick longitudinal displacement, to the right and left, of the tailstock quill. To move the quill
to the left (towards the spindle), turn the handwheel clockwise and vice versa to move the
quill to the right, rotate the handwheel anticlockwise.
