9 – Linear error compensation
The linear error compensation function is used for the correction of errors in the transmission
system of the lead screw.
The correction factor is expressed as:
where
L is the useful length of the Z axis in mm;
L’is the value displayed on the panel in mm;
S is the correction factor in mm/m.
The correction factor can be positive if the displayed value is less than the actual length,
negative if the value displayed is higher.
The compensation range is ± 1.500 mm/m.
Ex. If the useful length of the Y axes is 1000 mm and the panel at the end of travel of the
