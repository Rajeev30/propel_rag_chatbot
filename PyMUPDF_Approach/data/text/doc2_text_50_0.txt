11 MAINTENANCE
Electric shock
Before maintenance or checks, turn off the machine and ALWAYS unplug the power cord. This
is so that there is no risk of electric shock.
Regularly clean and take care of the machine to guarantee proper efficiency and a long
working life.
Use a compressor to blow off shavings, chips, filings and dust that has accumulated on the
floor of the machine and on the workbench at the end of each machining operation.
Working with compressed air
ALWAYS wear the protective goggles when using compressed air.
Check the status of the Lathe and the EC and warning plate; if these are no longer legible
request replacements.
