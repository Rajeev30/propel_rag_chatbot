The lathe is equipped with a support base and must be installed and used on flat surfaces,
with ergonomic features and adequate resistance.
The Lathe can operate in closed work environments (production halls, warehouses, etc.), i.e.
protected from the weather and where there is no danger of fire or explosion.
The operating temperature range is -20 to +50°C.
The environment must also be sufficiently illuminated so as to ensure operation in maximum
safety (at least 200 lux is recommended).
There are two main groups within the Lathe (see figure 1):

The spindle shaft unit;

The sliding tool holder unit.
