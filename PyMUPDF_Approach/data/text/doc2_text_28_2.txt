The panel for the adjustment of the spindle rotation speed (see Figure 16), is positioned at
the left part of the machine, between the spindle and the gearbox. It is equipped with two
levers, marked with colours, letters and numbers, for selection of the desired rotation speed,
depending on the type of processing and the material to be processed.
