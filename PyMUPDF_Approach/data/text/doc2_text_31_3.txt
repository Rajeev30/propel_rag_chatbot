allows the transversal displacement, forward and backward, of the tool holder slide. To move
the slide forward (towards the workpiece), turn the handwheel clockwise and vice versa to
move the slide backward (towards the operator), rotate the handwheel anticlockwise.
(N) Handwheel for longitudinal displacement of the tool holder slide: The handwheel
allows the quick longitudinal displacement, to the right and left, of the tool holder slide. To
move the slide to the left (towards the spindle), turn the handwheel clockwise and vice versa
to move the slide to the right (towards the tailstock), rotate the handwheel anticlockwise.
