gears present, including the pinion M which meshes with the rack N, which is moved by
dragging the carriage during the rotation of the pinion.

Transverse feed
The transverse feed is due to the transverse slide which drags the upper slide and the tool in
the perpendicular direction to the axis of the Lathe (see Figure 36). And by moving the lever
E to position 3, the idler wheel O meshes with the pinion G integral with the screw H. The
screw is coupled to the casing I integral with the transverse slide. The rotation of the screw
therefore moves the transverse slide.
