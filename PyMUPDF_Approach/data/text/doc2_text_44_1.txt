negative if the value displayed is higher.
The compensation range is Â± 1.500 mm/m.
Ex. If the useful length of the Y axes is 1000 mm and the panel at the end of travel of the
carriage, reads 999.98 mm then S=(1000-999.98)/(1000/1000)=0.02 mm/m.
So to enter the compensation value it is necessary to:
-
Select the Y axis by pressing the button
, pressing the
button displays the
correction factor S previously set.

-
Enter the calculated value 0.02 by pressing in sequence the keys 0 . 0 2
