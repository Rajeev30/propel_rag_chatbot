Longitudinal feed for threading:
The automatic longitudinal feed originates in the spindle, which transmits motion to the lead
screw connected to the spindle itself by means of gears that allow for the variation in the
rotational speed (see Figure 37).
The lead screw, with its rotation motion, exerts a thrust on the fixed casing of the carriage,
determining the automatic feed, in a longitudinal direction.
Figure 37 â€“ Longitudinal feed with the lead screw.
The change of feed speed of the Gear head lathe (Art. LC340/1000) is mixed: mechanical
with knobs for speed selection (see section 9.2.2) and with replaceable gears.
